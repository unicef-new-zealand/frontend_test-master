# Best Practics üç≠

Here are some tips for a successful test:

- Focus on your strengths within the time limit, but make sure the project is
  always runnable
- For example you might emphasise design, layout, code, ux, or something else you enjoy.
- Strive for (small) granular commits to show your progress
- Consider how the reviewer will test correct behavior
- Consider the experience of the end user
